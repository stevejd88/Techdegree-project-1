        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I am currently an Elementary teacher in the Dallas area, and and also taught in Austin, Texas. I have been a champion of children for the past seven years.  I love working with children, but I am ready to turn a new leaf in my life.</p>
        <p>I first started working with code in schools during yearly hour of code days.  Students worked with block code to program a Minecraft or Angry Birds game. It intrigued me how quickly students picked up what they were doing.  It inspired me to start practicing with HTML and CSS through various websites.  I really enjoyed and had fun with I was learning.  This led me to Team Treehouse's tech degree programs and inspired me to pursue a career in web development.</p>
