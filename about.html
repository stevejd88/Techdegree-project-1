        <h2>My Story</h2>
        <p>I am originally from El Paso, Texas. I graduated from The University of Texas at El Paso with a degree in Organizational and Corporate Communication. At the point of graduation my goal was to work for a non-profit in some capacity. This led me to land a job with an AmeriCorps program called ACE (now known as Literacy First). I worked as a Bilingiual Literacy Tutor for a few years. During this time I came to realize I liked making an impact on student's lives, so I decided to get my certification to become a classroom teacher.  While working with students over the years I have come in contact with coding during various times. I became more curious about coding over the years, and slowly began learning some aspects such as HTML and CSS. I have really enjoyed learning to code. The experience itself has led me to pursue a change of career. I hope to be a eb developer in the near future.</p>
